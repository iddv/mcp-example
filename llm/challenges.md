# Implementation Challenges

This document tracks challenges encountered during the implementation of the MCP example project and their solutions.

## Anticipated Challenges

### Function Call Parsing
- **Challenge**: LLMs may produce function calls in various formats, making parsing difficult
- **Potential Solution**: Implement a robust parser that can handle different formats and recover from errors
- **Status**: Not yet addressed

### Tool Result Streaming
- **Challenge**: Streaming results from long-running tools while maintaining connection
- **Potential Solution**: Implement asynchronous processing with WebSockets for real-time updates
- **Status**: Not yet addressed

### Error Handling Across Boundaries
- **Challenge**: Providing meaningful error messages across system boundaries (client/server)
- **Potential Solution**: Standardized error format with codes, messages, and context information
- **Status**: Not yet addressed

### Authentication and Security
- **Challenge**: Securing the API while keeping it usable
- **Potential Solution**: Implement API key authentication initially, with option for more advanced auth later
- **Status**: Not yet addressed

### AWS Bedrock Integration
- **Challenge**: Managing API rate limits and handling streaming responses
- **Potential Solution**: Implement backoff strategies and proper stream handling
- **Status**: Not yet addressed

### Function Call Validation
- **Challenge**: Validating complex nested parameter structures
- **Potential Solution**: Leverage JSON Schema validation with custom validation hooks
- **Status**: Not yet addressed
