# Design Decisions

This document tracks key design decisions made during the implementation of the MCP example project.

## Architecture Decisions

### Core Protocol Design
- **Decision**: Use JSON Schema for function definitions
- **Rationale**: JSON Schema provides a standardized way to define and validate structured data. It is widely supported and has extensive documentation.
- **Alternatives Considered**: Custom schema format, TypeScript interfaces, Protocol Buffers
- **Date**: 2024-05-22

### Tool Registry Implementation
- **Decision**: Implement a centralized registry with dynamic tool loading
- **Rationale**: A centralized registry simplifies tool discovery and management. Dynamic loading enables extensibility.
- **Alternatives Considered**: Hardcoded tool list, service discovery pattern
- **Date**: 2024-05-22

### Server Architecture
- **Decision**: Use FastAPI for the server implementation
- **Rationale**: FastAPI provides automatic OpenAPI documentation, type validation, and high performance. It also has good support for async operations.
- **Alternatives Considered**: Flask, Django, Express.js
- **Date**: 2024-05-22

### Client-Server Communication
- **Decision**: Support both HTTP and WebSockets for communication
- **Rationale**: HTTP is suitable for simple request-response patterns, while WebSockets enable streaming and bidirectional communication.
- **Alternatives Considered**: gRPC, GraphQL, pure WebSockets
- **Date**: 2024-05-22

## Implementation Decisions

### Error Handling
- **Decision**: Use standardized error responses with error codes and messages
- **Rationale**: Consistent error handling improves developer experience and simplifies debugging.
- **Alternatives Considered**: Exception propagation, minimal error responses
- **Date**: 2024-05-22

### Function Call Parsing
- **Decision**: Implement robust parsing with support for different formats
- **Rationale**: LLMs may produce various formats of function calls, so a flexible parser improves reliability.
- **Alternatives Considered**: Strict format enforcement, regex-based parsing
- **Date**: 2024-05-22

### Authentication
- **Decision**: Start with API key authentication, prepare for OAuth integration
- **Rationale**: API keys provide a simple starting point, while design should accommodate more advanced auth later.
- **Alternatives Considered**: OAuth-only, no authentication
- **Date**: 2024-05-22

## Technical Decisions

### Language and Environment
- **Decision**: Use Python 3.10+ for implementation
- **Rationale**: Python is widely used in ML/AI, has good async support, and is accessible to many developers.
- **Alternatives Considered**: JavaScript/TypeScript, Go, Rust
- **Date**: 2024-05-22

### Package Management
- **Decision**: Use Poetry for dependency management
- **Rationale**: Poetry provides deterministic builds, better dependency resolution, and simplified package management.
- **Alternatives Considered**: pip with requirements.txt, pipenv, conda
- **Date**: 2024-05-22

### Code Structure
- **Decision**: Organize code by functional area (core, tools, adapters, etc.)
- **Rationale**: This structure makes it easy to find and work with related code, and supports the modular design goal.
- **Alternatives Considered**: Feature-based organization, flat structure
