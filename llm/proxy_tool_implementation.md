# Proxy Tool Implementation

## Overview
The proxy tool enables forwarding function calls to remote MCP servers. This allows a client to interact with tools that are available on other servers without having to implement them directly. This implementation completes Phase 4.2 of the project plan.

## Implementation Details

### Key Components
1. **Proxy Tool Function**: Implements a tool that can forward requests to remote MCP servers using the HTTP client.
2. **Function Caching**: Caches function definitions from remote servers to reduce unnecessary network traffic.
3. **Error Handling**: Provides detailed error information when remote calls fail.
4. **Authentication Support**: Supports API key authentication for remote servers.

### File Structure
- `mcp_example/tools/proxy.py`: Main implementation of the proxy tool
- `tests/test_proxy_tool.py`: Unit tests for the proxy tool

### Functions

#### `proxy_call`
This is the core function that handles forwarding calls to remote servers. It:
1. Creates a client connection to the remote server
2. Checks if the requested function exists (using cached definitions when available)
3. Makes the call to the remote function
4. Processes and returns the result

#### `list_remote_functions`
A utility function to list all available functions on a remote server. This can be used to discover available tools on remote servers.

#### `register`
Registers the proxy tool with the global tool registry.

## Usage Example

To call a function on a remote server:

```python
from mcp_example.core.executor import executor

# Call the proxy tool
result = executor.execute(
    "proxy",
    {
        "server_url": "http://example-mcp-server.com",
        "function_name": "calculator",
        "parameters": {
            "operation": "add",
            "a": 5,
            "b": 3
        }
    }
)

print(f"Result: {result}")  # Result: 8
```

From the command line:

```bash
$ python -m mcp_example.cli
MCP> proxy server_url=http://example-mcp-server.com function_name=calculator parameters={"operation":"add","a":5,"b":3}
Result: 8
```

## Design Decisions

### Caching Strategy
The tool implements a simple caching mechanism for function definitions. When a server is first accessed, all function definitions are fetched and cached. This reduces latency for subsequent calls to the same server.

### Error Handling
Detailed error messages are provided to help users diagnose issues when remote calls fail. This includes server connection errors, authentication issues, and function-specific errors.

### Authentication
The tool supports API key authentication, which is a common method for securing API access. This is passed via header to the remote server.

## Testing
The implementation includes comprehensive unit tests that:
1. Verify correct forwarding of function calls
2. Test error handling for various failure scenarios
3. Validate function listing from remote servers
4. Ensure proper registration with the tool registry

## Future Enhancements
Potential future enhancements for the proxy tool include:
- Support for OAuth and other authentication methods
- More sophisticated caching with TTL-based invalidation
- Automatic discovery of remote servers
- Load balancing across multiple remote servers
